# PostgreSQL as a Service (PGaaS) DB VM.

This package is not being used in R2 Beijing because of the move to Kubernetes with OOM.

If you need this package, use the R1 Amsterdam release packages.

I'm not removing the repo though because it is likely that we will need to add things in R3 Casablanca.
